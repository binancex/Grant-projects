## Project Satoshi: Beginner pt.4 tutorial
**Project Satoshi is a list of milestones an aspiring developer can self-start in order to guide themselves along a solid path to proficiency in dapp development. The list is sequential, as later milestones may depend on previous ones. It is recommended that individuals start from the beginning no matter what their level. This tutorial should be an exemplary completion of the milestone, but structured as a tutorial**
# Concepts
This tutorial should have a special focus on functions, security, and data types in BSC smart contract development.  In this tutorial, the reader will learn how to do the following things from your written and video tutorials:
- Write and deploy a token swap contract that automatically exchanges token A to an equal balance of token B for all holders of token A, burning token A during the swap.

# Deliverables
- One <7min video (.mp4 or .avi), with clear English audio that can be uploaded to our YouTube channel
- One Google doc with tutorial steps and main takeaways (well-structured and concise)
- Another Google Doc whose content is a publishable blog post of the tutorial with screenshots (more detail than the previous Google doc)
- Solidity source code with comments and correct styling
