## Project Satoshi: Beginner pt.2 tutorial
**Project Satoshi is a list of milestones an aspiring developer can self-start in order to guide themselves along a solid path to proficiency in dapp development. The list is sequential, as later milestones may depend on previous ones. It is recommended that individuals start from the beginning no matter what their level. This tutorial should be an exemplary completion of the milestone, but structured as a tutorial**
# Concepts
This tutorial should have a special focus on functions, security, and data types in BSC smart contract development. In this tutorial, the reader will lean how to do the following things from your written and video tutorials:

- Contract allows the owner to withraw ETH from the contract. 
- If the owner does not withdraw for mor than 1 month, an heir can take control of the contract and designate a new heir.
- It is possible for the owner to withdraw 0 ETH just to reset the one month counter.
